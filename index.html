        Loud and enormous, the Primadon is a giant aquatic ape Boss. 
        It is a bipedal primate creature, standing at nearly 81 feet (25 meters), 
        with some features of marine life, featuring webbed feet and fins on its shoulders, 
        hips, and head.

        It features blue-grey fur, and prior to Verse 2, Primadon had a dark blue face. 
        After Verse 2, 
        the model was changed slightly to make Primadon shorter and flip its lip inside out, 
        much like real life primates do to show aggression.
